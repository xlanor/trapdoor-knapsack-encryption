                    A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to solve one way but not the other.

                    A trapdoor function f with its trapdoor t can be generated by an algorithm Gen.
                    f can be efficiently computed, i.e., in probabilistic polynomial time.
                    However, the computation of the inverse of f is generally hard, unless the trapdoor t is given.
                    {"\n\n"}
                    An example of trapdoor function is the discrete logarithm problem
                    {"\n"}
                    a^k = b
                    {"\n"}
                    Given b, can you find a and k? Probably not in an acceptable amount of time.
                    However you can get b from a^k easily.
                    {"\n\n"}
                    The trapdoor knapsack is a combination of these 2 properties.
