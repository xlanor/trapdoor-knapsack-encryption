    "text": `<p>The trapdoor knapsack is also known as the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem and is invented by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978. The general idea behind this algorithm is to create two separate problems - one of which is easy to solve, giving the private key, and the other being difficult to solve, giving a public key. This ensures that the private key is easy to use, but the public key is difficult to compute. As such, this functions as a “trapdoor”, ensuring that without proper knowledge of the trapdoor, the encryption cannot easily be reversed. However Trapdoor knapsack has been broken.
