    "text": `<p>The trapdoor knapsack is also known as the <b>Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem</b> and was invented by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978. <br/><br/>
  The general idea behind this algorithm is to create <b>two</b> separate problems - one of which is <b><u>easy to solve</u></b>, giving the private key, and the other being <b><u>difficult to solve</u></b>, giving a public key.<br/><br/>
  This ensures that the private key is easy to use, but the public key is difficult to compute. <br/>
  As such, this functions as a “trapdoor”, ensuring that without proper knowledge of the trapdoor, the encryption <b>cannot easily be reversed</b>.
