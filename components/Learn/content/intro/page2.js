unless the trapdoor is given, in which case, it will be easy to compute.<br/><br/>
A good example of the trapdoor function is the <br/>
<b><u>Discrete Logarithm problem</u></b><br/> <br/>
Assuming we have a function<br/>
a<sup>k</sup> = b<br/>
Given b, we would be unable to find <u>a</u> and <u>k</u> in a <b>reasonable time!</b>.
